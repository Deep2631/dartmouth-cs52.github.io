CS52 is going remote! In some ways, the class is fairly well suited to this already. However,  we need to be intentional about a few key things for successful communication and collaboration. These are outlined below, along with general tips for remote work. 

- **Jump ahead**
    - [Tools](#tools)
    - [Personal Strategies](#personal-strategies)
    - [Team Strategies](#team-strategies)
    - [Communication & Collaboration](#communication-and-collaboration)

# Tools

Most of the tools listed below are not new to CS52's workflow, but we will use them in more specific ways, so please read on and make sure you know how to use them.

  * [Slack](#slack)
  * [Zenhub](#zenhub)
  * [Zoom](#zoom)
  * [Tandem](#tandem)
  * [Figma](#figma)
  * [GitHub](#github)
  * [VSCode](#vscode)

## Slack

This will be the primary tool we use for text-based communication and collaboration. All important course notifications will be broadcast in Slack. 

### **Expectations**

- Read *and* respond to Slack messages at least every 24hrs ‚Äî suggested to manage notifications so you get them for things like the #20s channel and your final project team channel.
- Thread conversations. If you have a conversation over Slack with your team, thread conversations where appropriate to avoid spamming the channel.

### Zoom

For video calls and screen sharing. 

Join with your [Dartmouth account](http://dartmouth.zoom.us/) for the Pro version or your call will end at 40 minutes. 

### Zoom etiquette

- Use headphones with a mic for better audio quality, if possible.
- Mute when you're not speaking. (hold **space** to temporarily unmute yourself!)
- Make visible (bigger) gestures: body language is harder to capture in a small video. Hold smiles longer, give thumbs up, etc. (raise hands, thumbs up, etc.)
- Use the chat for sharing links, not a side conversation (focus on the person speaking).
- Keep your video on to stay engaged (unless your connection is poor).
- Take calls in a quiet place.
- Embrace the latency and know that you might speak at the same time as someone else and give them go first.
- Use the gallery view ****so you can actually see how everyone is reacting.
- Use screen-sharing to your advantage, but not unless necessary. Keep those videos up when you can!

### Expectations

- Record Calls (in cloud): all partner meetings, user interviews/testing, other important conversations. Ask for permission verbally.
- Preschedule Zoom calls: put the **link in a calendar invite** to make it easy for everyone to find and you'll avoid the last-minute "what link are we using?"
    - PMs should create one consistent link for team meetings, and one for partner meetings.

### How do I...

- **Record Meetings**

    [Recoding Meetings on Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording)

    - The Meeting Host (likely the PM) should have Recording set to "on" in their preferences, and choose to save as .mp4 to their computer.
    - Save and upload all recordings to the team Drive.
- **Screen Share**

    Share your screen and progress. Great to show decks/ designs/ code to partners and team!

    [Screen Sharing on Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen)

- **Schedule Meetings**

    You can make a one time or recurring meetings, set preferences, etc.

    [Schedule Meetings on Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362413-Scheduling-meetings)

- **Use Zoom Whiteboard**

    Great for visualizing ideas in meetings! Especially great when paired with an iPad.

    [Using Zoom Whiteboard](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205677665-Sharing-a-whiteboard)

- **Use Zoom Polling**

    You can create single or multiple choice polling questions in your meetings. This will help you gather responses from attendees. Great for workshops and large meetings.

    [Polling](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/213756303-Polling-for-Meetings) With Zoom

- **Receive Non-Verbal Feedback**

    Participants can place icons near their names to communicate with the host and other participants. 

    [Non-Verbal Feedback](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115001286183-Nonverbal-Feedback-During-Meetings)

- **Use Zoom Breakout Rooms**

    You can split one call into multiple groups/side conversations!

    [Getting Started with Breakout Rooms](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476093-Getting-Started-with-Breakout-Rooms)

Pro tip: integrate Zoom with Slack!
Click on the **phone icon** in your channel to launch a Zoom call or type `/zoom`

### Tandem

Mainly for solidarity, casual hellos, and to use during work sessions. It is a lightweight tool that allows for **pop-in conversations** and/or screen-sharing while you are working.

### Figma etc.

**Mandatory**: Follow the welcome instructions on the cover page of your project's Figma file.

- If you use another tool for brainstorming (like Mural or Zoom whiteboard), **export** the output and place into Figma.

### Expectations

- All team members should be familiar with Figma and know where to find the most recent designs.

### GitHub

For development work version-control, houses code documentation, and overall project management via Zenhub.

### Expectations

- **All team members should be familiar with GitHub** and know where to find things on a high-level
- **README should be kept updated** throughout the term.
- Code should be pushed early and often. Don't let your hard work die if your computer does!
- **Mandatory:** Follow the guidelines for **[creating issues]()** and **[submitting PRs**.]()

### VS Code

# Personal Strategies

Suggestions for taking care of yourself and positioning yourself for a term of successful academics and CS52  work.

- Communicate with the other people in your house: what are you expectations for each other, when is social time vs. work time, what are indicators of focus time (e.g. headphones on or door closed)?
- Set up your work environment and optimize it for productivity (e.g. find a quiet place, clear off your desk/table, natural light, etc.). For best results, keep your work and play spaces separate.
- If you have the space, avoid working in your bedroom, and definitely don't work in bed. Your sleep quality will suffer, and we all know we need that!
- Maintain your normal routine as much as possible and practice health habits like exercise.
    - Play with your dogs! üê∂
    - Go outside on a walk (if you can and it is safe to do so!)
- Pace yourself: Remember to take breaks, get up and walk around. The **Pomodoro Method** is a great reminder, and there's a [plugin for Slack](https://pomodoneapp.com/pomodoro-timer-for-slack.html)!
- Be gentle towards yourself and others. Remember that we are all under different circumstances and stressors than usual and it's okay if you're not always productive. Your identity and worth is not in your work.
- Help others: your family, teammates, etc. Much like how giving presents is more fun than receiving them, giving to and caring for others can take our minds off our ourselves in a real and energizing way!
- Block out time on your calendar for CS52 work and share it with your team. Since we are spread across different timezones and have different routines now, it is especially important that you communicate your work schedule to your teammates.
- Keep your Slack status updated (available/unavailable). Make it clear when you are working on CS52 stuff versus derping around watching cat videos or doing schoolwork.
- Set clear boundaries. While we expect you to respond to Slack frequently, you do not need to be available 24/7. Take some time off, just communicate with your team about your plans/schedule!
- Struggling in big or small ways? Let your team, mentor, or staff know ‚Äî **we are all here to help**.

# Team Strategies

Teams will largely operate in the same ways, just replacing in-person meetings with video calls and making a few other operation alterations.

- Pre-plan social time. Teams that care for each other (that empathy thing) and laugh together have smoother dynamics, more meaningful collaboration, and more fun working together. We don't have to forfeit building those relationships just because we are remote. Get creative, but start by designating time at the beginning or end of your meetings for just chatting about the weather, religion, politics, and your cat.
- Use video calls for team meetings, partner meetings, and work sessions. See each other's faces as much as possible! a) Because we are a good-looking crew, b) because it is much easier to detect tone and intention in facial expressions.
    - As before, these meetings should be set as soon as possible and be scheduled for the same time every week.
    - Put these meetings in a team calendar with the Zoom links within the event, so no one is every scrambling to find it last minute.
- Work together as much as possible. As usual, you must meet as an entire team for 3hrs/week, excluding partner meetings. In addition, work with your dev/des counterparts for for minimum of 2hrs/week.
- Adhere to [CS52‚Äôs Agile guidelines]() for project planning, task management, and collaboration.
    - Sprint planning is an important addition!
- Meetings:
    - As before: you should know what is to be discussed, how long it will last, and what to prepare for every meeting.
    - Allocate time for non-work chatter.
    - Everyone add items to the agenda throughout the week: have an Zenhub card for the meeting agenda that anyone can add to.

# Communication and Collaboration

We are used to communicating and collaborating best in-person. Now we need to learn how to do the same, but remotely. Technology is great, but it can also mask intention, perception, and humanity, so we need to take extra steps to work well together. Initially some of the extra intentionality it takes will feel awkward, but it's well worth it to build a positive experience for you and everyone else.

Steps to take:

- Always assume positive intent in communication. Tone and nuance do not always come across over chat, thus assuming your teammate is coming from a positive place helps to smooth over any potential misunderstandings as they are being ironed out. Punctuation matters!
- Take the extra time to be clear in all your communication.
    - Avoid vague words like: he/she/it, just refer exactly to what you are talking about (e.g. he = tom, it = the hamburger menu)
    - Give a little bit more info than you might think necessary
- Consider asynchronous work that will be demanded by timezones and different home schedules. This takes forward-thinking:
    - Keep decisions written down and public so the people waking up when you go to sleep can get right to work
    - As before, all communication project-related should happen in the public channels, so anyone can chime in and read up on what is happening.
    - Plan ahead: don't leave decisions until the last minute, so everyone can be part of the decision.
- Set ground rules for yourself and your team:
    - Always give constructive feedback via video so your intentions, and their response, are clear
    - Make decisions in video calls, not chats (and write them down!)
    - When to slack vs. video call vs. everything else. For example:

        if: time sensitive, then: slack; else: zenhub

- Keep in mind that everyone is living in a different context and we don't know the full extent of what people are dealing with. Share your contexts with each other as much as you feel comfortable, and always assume the best in each other.
- Check in with your team more often to make sure miscommunication doesn't build up resentment or hurt feelings.
- Mentorship will still happen! Mentors and staff are available for regular and as-needed Zoom calls.
