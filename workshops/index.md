# CS52 Workshops Assignment

![](http://i.giphy.com/eUh8NINbZf9Ys.gif)

Each workshop session will consist of two parts: a zoom slide presentation to the class and a do-at-your-own-pace tutorial on a web technology, tool, framework, or concept. 

The presentation will be 20 minutes to motivate the technology, show its use cases and 

The tutorial will be a written online document in the form of a [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) readme file in a git repo.


## To Start

We'll be using **github classroom** to autoprovision repositories and set up teams.

Every member on your team **must** use github classroom to set up the teams correctly and automatically.  Find the link for github classroom on the Canvas assignment.

The first person on your team will name the repo and the team. Each consecutive person will click on the same github classroom link and simply choose the repo and team to be granted permissions. Please use this as it keeps everything organized and in one place. Remember, use the github classroom to create **and join** the repository. Everybody on your team must click this link. Do not add team members as collaborators manually.

## Workshop Overview

* [10-15 Minute Intro Presentation](#presentation-section)
* [30 Minute Tutorial](#tutorial-section)
* [5-10 Minute Wrap-Up Discussion](#wrap-up-discussion-section)

## Teams

Teams of ~5 will be formed around dates and a set of potential topics. Your and your team may chose 1 or 2 technologies from the list or may suggest alternative related technologies/topics.

## Setup

If your tutorial requires any lengthy download or install procedures please let the class know at least 2 days in advance.

## Details

### Presentation Section

~(10-15 minutes)

* motivate the technology
* show where the technology fits into the web dev process (dev tool, frontend framework, preprocessor, language etc)
* show some use cases
* discuss pros/cons

Motivating the technology is import.  This should start with an [ELI5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/) and then you can expand to how it fits in with what we've learned so far and use cases. What is the big deal about this thing you are presenting, why should I care? 

### Tutorial Section

(~30-40 minutes)

Your written tutorial document will be a walkthrough of building something using the specific web technologies.

It should include:

* Overview of what will be attempted
* Any necessary setup steps
* Step by step instructions
* Explanations of the what **and** the why behind each step. Try to include:
  * higher level concepts
  * best practices
* 2 reflection questions

End the tutorial with a "what you should have at this point" section which includes a **short** listing of features. This is the minimal set of things you think they should accomplished/learned during the course of the tutorial and will be used in grading. Format this as a checklist:

- [x] created navbar
- [ ] styled body
- [ ] clickable buttons


### Wrap-Up Discussion Section

(~5-10 minutes)

* lead short discussion
* answer questions
* individual teams share results


## To Turn In (due after workshop):

* link to github repo for tutorial
* link or file upload of presentation slides
* a brief (3 short paragraphs) summary of the workshop itself (just in canvas):
  * what went well
  * what didn't
  * what you would do differently "next time"
