Start here:
[18S-git-map](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-18S/git-map)

### To Turn In

1. URLs to your successfully closed pull requests (you can find your pull requests [here](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-18S/git-map/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)). Its ok and normal to have several of these, you don't have to have gotten it right the first time. Requirements:
  * your github username and email are correctly set
  * you made a branch and did a pull request that was successfully merged into **dartmouth-cs52-18S/git-map:master**
  * your face marker appears on the main page:  http://map.cs52.me
  * and your marker is clickable and shows your people page
1. A short answer response to:
  * How comfortable do you feel you are with git after this assignment/workshop?
  * Is there anything about git flow you'd like covered in more detail?

### Extra Credit

* Not much available here, you can make your page look prettier for EC on sa1.
* You could play around with adding more things to the map or improving how things are scaled or displayed on the map (difficult).
* Make a pull request to fix any bugs in the workshop README.md, leave these open so we can see them.
