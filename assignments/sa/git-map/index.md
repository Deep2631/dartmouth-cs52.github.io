First things first. If you didn't fill out the beginning of term survey on canvas, you'll need to join the github team:

Did you accept the invitation to the https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-19S organization via this link:  [https://classroom.github.com/g/F2r_btUo](https://classroom.github.com/g/F2r_btUo)?  When prompted please join the **19s** group! Otherwise you won't have permissions on the repo to do anything with it. 

Start here:
[19S-git-map](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-19S/git-map)

### To Turn In

1. URLs to your successfully closed pull requests (you can find your pull requests [here](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-19S/git-map/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)). Its ok and normal to have several of these, you don't have to have gotten it right the first time. Requirements:
  * your [github username and email are correctly set](https://help.github.com/en/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user)
  * you made a branch and did a pull request that was successfully merged into **dartmouth-cs52-19S/git-map:master**
  * your face marker appears on the main page:  http://map.cs52.me
  * and your marker is clickable and shows your people page
1. A short answer response to:
  * How comfortable do you feel you are with git after this assignment/workshop?
  * Is there anything about git flow you'd like covered in more detail?

### Extra Credit

* You could play around with adding more things to the map or improving how things are scaled or displayed on the map (difficult).
* Help fix someone else's merge conflicts or json bugs in the file.
