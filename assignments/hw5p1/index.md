## Redux Blog: Client

![](img/redux.png)

We'll build a React+Redux Blog Platform.  It doesn't even necessarily have to be a blog,  could be photo's or really anything you want. As long as there are individual post items that have some content that need to be saved to a database!

### Part 1 HW4

We'll build out a Create+Update+Delete (CRUD) style blogging app using React and Redux and React-Router.  We will use an API server hosted at: `cs52-blog.herokuapp.com`

### Part 2 HW5

We will rip out `cs52-blog.herokuapp.com` and build our own Nodejs+Express+Mongo based API server.  Finally FULL-STACK!


## Some Setup


First we should do some basic setup steps.  

ðŸš€ You should start from your react+redux+starter from the [redux workshop](../workshops/redux) or you can grab the **with_redux** branch from the [js-react-starter](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52/js-react-starter).  Do the usual: create your own repo and change the remote.

ðŸš€ Webpack. When a route reloads to an error webpack-dev-server needs to know that it should always serve up our app from index.html even when we end up asking it for another route.


```javascript
//add to webpack.config.js
devServer: {
  port: 8080,
  historyApiFallback: {
    index: 'index.html',
  },
},
```

ðŸš€ We should also make sure some of our paths in `index.html` are correct. Make sure each of the build paths starts with / like `/build/bundle.css` and `/build/bundle.js`.


Ok, now that we got that out of the way. Let's dig in!


## CRUD API

We'll be using an API server running at http://cs52-blog.herokuapp.com/api

The API has the following endpoints:

* GET  `/api/posts/`
  returns **only** title, tags, and id for all posts
  `[[{"id":"",title":"","tags":""},...]`
* POST `/api/posts/` with post parameters `{'title', 'tags', 'content'}`
  creates a new post
* PUT `/api/posts/:postID` with parameters `{'title', 'tags', 'content'}`
  will update an entry
* GET `/api/posts/:postID`
  returns the full post data found at `postID`, including `content`
* DELETE `/api/posts/:postID`
  deletes the post found at `postID`


For each of these you need to append an api key.  This key can just be your `firstinitial_lastname`.   You can test the api using postman or curl.

There is a command that you can run in Terminal called `curl` that can fetch remote data.  Here's how you would use it for testing the api server.  This will also come in handy when you have to create the api server next week!

```bash
# all posts get:
curl -X GET "https://cs52-blog.herokuapp.com/api/posts?key=YOURKEY"

# create new post
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "title": "first post",
    "tags": "words",
    "content":  "this is a test post"
}' "https://cs52-blog.herokuapp.com/api/posts/?key=YOURKEY"

# update by POSTID
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "title": "new title",
    "tags": "new words",
    "content":  "old content"
}' "https://cs52-blog.herokuapp.com/api/posts/POSTID?key=YOURKEY"

# fetch 1 by POSTID
curl -X GET "https://cs52-blog.herokuapp.com/api/posts/POSTID?key=YOURKEY"

# delete by POSTID
curl -X DELETE -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://cs52-blog.herokuapp.com/api/posts/POSTID?key=YOURKEY"

```

Try these out.  Run the create new post one a couple of times to populate your database!




## Routes

We're going to use some routes to set up our app with different "pages".  

ðŸš€ Your routes could look something like this.  Basically you're going to have a route for creating new posts (this will be a form) and a page for showing a post by ID. The default route will show a list of all posts.


```html
<Route path="/" component={App}>
  <IndexRoute component={Index} />
  <Route path="posts/new" component={New} />
  <Route path="posts/:id" component={Show} />
</Route>
```

This is just the basics, feel free to expand on this. For reference it might help to look back on the [routes workshop](../workshops/routing).


### App

Is a simple component that simply renders a *NavBar* component and the `{props.children}` passed in by the router. You can think of this as your main layout â€” you can rename it to that if you prefer!


### NavBar

A simple component that renders a nav with two `<Link>` react-router components such as the following:

* `<Link to="/">your site name</Link>`
* `<Link to="posts/new">new post</Link>`


### Index

This will be the default page.  It will display a list of posts.  These posts can look like whatever you want.  The posts will be stored in the redux state rather than any single component so this will need to be a connected component that connects to `state.posts.all`.

Try the curl commands above,  you'll see that one of the fields you get back in the JSON is `id`.  You'll use that construct `Link` elements to `posts/postid` when you render the posts. Each post should be clickable to open it full page using the router.

Min specs at a glance:

* default page listing all posts
* show title and tags (for now)
* use post id to link to full view

Hint: As this is a connected component that relies on the list of posts, you'll want to run your `fetchPosts()` ActionCreator from `componentWillMount`.

### New

Component to create a new blog post (you can reuse this component for editing posts if you like). Should be a connected component that can trigger actions (ActionCreators).

### Show + edit

This is the component that gets loaded when you want to see the full rendered contents of a single post.  *Show* should display the full content of the post (selected by the ID that is passed in through `this.props.params.id`.  This post id parameter will come from the react-router when you navigate to:  `/posts/:postID`.  Where does postID come from in general?  It is automatically assigned to your post by the API when you create the post.

Your *Show* component should provide a way to edit the post.  You can either have an edit button that makes the whole post editable, or you could have in place editing for each field as in the gif.  Another option is to have an edit route:  `/posts/:id/edit` for instance.  Personal preference here.

Note for now the API server only supports title, tags, content as fields.  In part 2 you will implement your own server and can add or change fields then.

Min specs at a glance:

* render full content of post at route `/posts/:id`
* render markdown
* allow editing of post fields
  * either in separate form or as individual editable fields

This is a connected component that can both trigger actions and is connected to the global redux state.

## Redux

We will be using [redux](http://redux.js.org/) for our application state.  We're going to just have 1 reducer to start with: `postsReducer`.   This reducer will be associated with the key `posts` and will return an object to look something like this initially:

```javascript
posts: {
  all: [],
  post: null,
}
```


## Actions

Here are some actions you should consider implementing.  Note, only FETCH_POST and FETCH_POSTS need to be handled by the reducer in this implementation. However, you should still package up all the asynchronous calls in ActionCreators to keep everything in the same place.

```javascript
export const ActionTypes = {
  FETCH_POSTS: 'FETCH_POSTS',
  FETCH_POST:  'FETCH_POST',
  // CREATE_POST: 'CREATE_POST',
  // UPDATE_POST: 'UPDATE_POST',
  // DELETE_POST: 'DELETE_POST',
};
```

Now you might ask,  how the heck do we fetch from an API using actions!?

Don't worry, this part I'll walk you through.

###  Connecting to API

First thing we'll need is to install the `redux-thunk` library. Not another library!  Actually, we'll need two libraries for this functionality. `axios` will give us an nice promise based ajax library.


```javascript

npm install --save redux-thunk
npm install --save axios

```

#### [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

Axios gives us a promise based interface to make API requests.   Here is an example of a get:

```javascript
const ROOT_URL = 'https://cs52-blog.herokuapp.com/api';
const API_KEY = '?key=yourfirstname_yourlastname';

axios.get(`${ROOT_URL}/posts${API_KEY}`).then(response => {
  // do something with response.data  (some json)
}).catch(error => {
  // hit an error do something else!
});
```


Axios supports *GET*, *POST*, *PUT*, *DELETE*, and other *HTTP* verbs.

With *POST* and *PUT* you need to supply an object with key,value data.  Something like the following would work:

```javascript
const fields = {title: '', contents:'', tags: ''}
axios.post(`${ROOT_URL}/posts${API_KEY}`, fields)
```


#### [Thunks](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)

The big question on your mind is how you would put this into an action I bet.  Right?  No?

We have to set up `redux-thunk` first.

ðŸš€ In your root `index.js` file:

```javascript
// at the top
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

// change the applyMiddleware line:
applyMiddleware(thunk),
```

We'll dig more into what middleware is later, but for now what you need to know is that middleware are basically functions that run between other stuff. They can be very powerful.  

Redux middleware wraps the dispatch function, allowing our `redux-thunk` middleware to process not just actions but also functions.  ActionCreators can now return thunks rather than just actions.  These thunks are functions that are created on the fly to run something later.  Whaaaat?

Remember how ActionCreators just return an Action?  Well, what if you want the ActionCreator to first do something, perhaps fetch something from the internet?  Thunks allow this functionality.  Instead of immediately returning an Action object and flowing into the Reducer, we return a function that gets executed and can go off and do some stuff before dispatching the Action.

A redux thunk allows your ActionCreators to return functions that can then dispatch actions.  Quite literally giving them access to a `dispatch` method.

```javascript
export function anAction() {
  // ActionCreator returns a function
  // that gets called with dispatch
  return (dispatch) => {
      // can now dispatch stuff
      dispatch({ type: 'SOME_ACTION', payload: {stuff: ''} });
  };
}
```

Dispatch is a function available in redux that handles distributing actions to reducers. In a connected component when you `mapDispatchToProps` you are wiring certain ActionCreators to automatically be called by `dispatch` like so:

![](img/dispatch.png){: .fancy .small}

With the redux-thunk middleware we are changing how dispatch works slightly.  We enable dispatch to accept not just action objects but also functions. These functions when executed can run asynchronous methods and upon return can manually `dispatch` further actions.  These further actions can be either action objects (what we will be doing) or for more complicated logic can be further thunk functions.

![](img/dipatch+thunk.png){: .fancy .small}

What we want to do is go and fetch some data from a rest api.  Being able to dispatch things in the middle of an action helps us do this. You'll want to do the `axios` call inside of your returned function.  You would dispatch the action if the promise was resolved and you potentially dispatch an error action in the catch.  You are combining the `redux-thunk` style ActionCreator with the `axios` api call.

You should have ActionCreator methods to deal with every axios call.

Here are the methods that you should have in your `actions/index.js` file:

```javascript
export function fetchPosts() {/* axios get */}

export function createPost(post) {/* axios post */}

export function updatePost(post) {/* axios put */}

export function fetchPost(id) {/* axios get */}

export function deletePost(id) {/* axios delete */}
```

Each of these methods will return a function that takes dispatch as its argument, runs some axios call, and then dispatches some action. In the above that ActionType actions are named the same as the functions, however it might help to think of them as FETCH_POSTS_SUCCEEDED for instance.  It is the action that is dispatched to the reducers with the payload results of the asynchronous call.

In the `.then` success call on create and delete you may find it useful to simply navigate to another page.  For instance when you hit delete on a blog post *Show* page you would want to be taken back to the Index page.  Simple add `browserHistory.push('/')` to navigate to another page from within your ActionCreator function (you'll need to `import { browserHistory } from 'react-router'` also).  

## Reducers

To start with we'll only need 1 reducer in `reducers/index.js`.  Something like this:

```javascript
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  posts: PostsReducer,
});
```

The `postReducer` that you will define will currently only need to respond to 2 ActionTypes:  FETCH_POST, and FETCH_POSTS.

Earlier, we defined are state as looking something like:

```javascript
posts: {
  all: [],
  post: null,
}
```

Where `all` would contain an array of all posts, and `post` would be the current individually displaying post (for *Show*).

For FETCH_POSTS you would return the state object with the `all` property set to the new posts.  For FETCH_POST return that single post.  

Note, since we are structuring things so that the reducer returns an object, for each of the actions you'll need to return the existing state of the other fields.  You can use the `Object.assign` method we have used before, or the es6 [object spread operator](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/UsingObjectSpreadOperator.html).  You are also welcome to implement it with multiple reducers if that is easier to reason about.


## And you are on your way!

That should be all you need to build a simple blog platform (we'll add more features later!).

If you don't know where to start, remember the steps in creating an React application (modified here to include redux considerations):

1. Start with a mock
1. Break the UI into a component hierarchy
1. Build the Presentational Components for a static version without any state
1. Identify what the local vs redux "global" state should be
1. Implement local UI state in Presentational components
1. Identify Redux Actions (things that change global state)
1. Create ActionCreators for each action
1. Write Reducers for each Action
1. Connect necessary components to Redux
1. Style it
1. Ship it


It might help for the ActionCreator -> Dispatch -> Reducer -> State flow, to try getting one working first.  For instance maybe get the *Show* component working first, the others will come more easily once you have the full path tested with one of them.

Don't forget to use the [hw4 slack channel](https://cs52-dartmouth.slack.com/messages/hw4/).

## To Turn In

1. GitHub repository URL
1. your working domain name URL on surge.sh
1. App should have individual routes for:
  * new
  * list view
  * full show view
1. App should make CRUD api calls
  * create
  * update
  * delete
  * fetch post by id
  * fetch all posts
1. your repo should include a README.md file with:
  * a couple sentence description about what you did
  * and what worked / didnâ€™t work
  * any extra credit attempted




## Extra Credit

* look snazzy
* handle axios errors in a graceful way, showing users a nice message rather than just console logging. (hint: new action and error state)
* input validation â€” check that all fields have required values when creating new form for instance.
* add a filter posts functionality, filter by tags initially.
  * for now our api is limited so additional search will come in part 2
* more EC available in part 2!
