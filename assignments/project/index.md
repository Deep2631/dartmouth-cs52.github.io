The last 3 weeks of class will be dedicated to a group project.  This will be a project of your own devising, built from the ground up (libraries/apis are allowed).  There are required components such as having both an api server+database and a clientside that you have to build through a series of milestones. Best practices, group dynamics, agile, etc will all be on the menu.
