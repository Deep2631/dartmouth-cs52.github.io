The last 3 weeks of class will be dedicated to a group project.  This will be a project of your own devising, built from the ground up (but as always libraries/apis are allowed).  There are required components that you have to build as well a bunch of milestones. Best practices, group dynamics, agile, etc will all be on the menu.
