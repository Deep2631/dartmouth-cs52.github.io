Final presentations and demos of the projects. Will be open to public!

17S, we will have this event in the Hanover Inn Ballroom and will have over 400 people attending!

Each team will set up their table with a large screen to show the project, have demos running, as well as a brief set of slides that:

* Motivate the idea
* Show it in action
* Discuss challenges
* Show user testing
