<!-- ![](img/pitch.gif){: .fancy .medium} -->

A <3 minute presentation with a little bit of Q&A to pitch your idea to the class. You can pitch with *at most 1* other person.

## The Pitch:

* Motivate idea / the problem, tell a story! Everyone loves stories.
* Propose either:
  * a potential solution
  * OR pose a problem you want to attempt to solve without a solution
  * OR even just a topic that you think might be interesting to brainstorm around
* Discuss any insights you might have into the problem

Add your slides to the shared google presentation on canvas!  Follow the template, but feel free to add graphics/customize look and feel of your slides.

Please, don't be shy, your idea is great! Pitch cause you care. Pitch for the practice. Pitch to make a difference. Pitch to inspire!

Not everybody needs to pitch — but the more the better!

To give you a sense of some scope and possibilities [here are some projects](20s) from last year. Let's push the boundaries even more this year!

Some thoughts:
* There are [lots of fascinating apis](https://www.programmableweb.com/) out there: from beer reviews to machine learning, and vision apis, to fictional datasets. Could you integrate some of these to enhance your idea?
* Games, could you take some known game and make it a site or mobile app?
* Is there an existing product that you want to clone but with a special take.  Uber for puppies, airbnb for breakfast sandwiches, cryptocurrencies for goldfish?
* Your ideas can be serious, world changing, or completely silly.  The point is to enjoy building something cool.

Once teams are created around these pitches, you will have an opportunity to brainstorm a bit more as your team so these don't lock you in.

* for fun here are some startup pitch decks: https://www.cirrusinsight.com/blog/startup-pitch-decks 

## To Turn In:

* name of your pitch partner if you have one
* working title
* max 8 word tagline
