Demos are now done!  Hopefully, everything worked perfectly.  Just a couple of last things to do.  

## README's
Make sure all your readme's are updated and that getting the project up and running for testing is possible based on your documentation. Run this through to make sure it works, as it is worth some points.

## Summary
Submit a debrief of the term and your team survey (on canvas!).  Super short - please do not spend a lot of time on this. I want to get a sense of how things went for you.

## Gifs
Create several gifs of your product in action. These can be short - show some cool part of your product working. This will be displayed for posterity to inspire the next generation, so make them inspirational! and they are required! you don't need to highlight each individual feature - just your app in general. Future classes don't care that you have a login page - they do care to see what your product is all about.

There are lots of gif making apps out there: [gif brewery](https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery), [giphycapture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture), [screentogif](http://www.screentogif.com/)

Add these to your project wiki homepage, or to a `In Action` wiki page.
