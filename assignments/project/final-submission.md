Demos are now done!  Hopefully, everything worked perfectly.  Just a couple of last things to do.  

## README's
Make sure all your readme's are updated and that getting the project up and running for testing is possible based on your documentation.  

## Summary
Submit a debrief of the term and your team survey (on canvas!).  Super short - please do not spend a lot of time on this. I want to get a sense of how things went for you.

## Gifs
Create several gifs of your product in action. These can be short - show some cool part of your product working. This will be displayed for posterity to inspire the next generation!

There are lots of gif making apps out there: [gif brewery](https://gfycat.com/gifbrewery), [giphycapture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture), [screentogif](http://www.screentogif.com/)
