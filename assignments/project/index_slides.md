???
* do we think education is optimal?
* queue soap box - turns out giving students a giant textbook to read and talking at them for an hour isn't the way the brain works.  we are amazing learners - you learn language mostly just by listening - an infants brain learns phonemes and words by analyzing the distribution of sounds. probabilistic statistical learning
* pre-tty _ ba-by (transitional probabilities, that a syllable will occur given a previous) oral speach has no real boundaries
* we do this automatically.
* at 11 months old babies can distinguish grammatical from non-grammatical sentences
