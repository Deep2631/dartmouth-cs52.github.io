* Have a greater appreciation for frontend so that .orange[**my code can be implemented as well as possible**]
* have the tools to .orange[**build real working web apps**]!
* web dev is most important types of development because it .orange[**interacts with the user most often and most directly**]
* have a small .orange[**collection of really neat projects**].
* Get a feeling of the group-working environment for software engineerss
* I'd like to be a .orange[**pro web developer by the end**] of this course!

???
* what is this full-stack thing?
* the stack is the set of tools/concepts/steps
  involved in building a modern client-server application
  (in particular on the web)
* how data is stored
* how it is communicated/transferred
* how it is displayed

client ⇔ server ⇔ database

???
* a full-stack dev implies working knowledge of all the components
* my favorite classes have always been those that empower - this will hopefully make you all magicians

name: CS52 Tech Stack

* client-side:
  * HTML5/CSS3(SASS)/ES6:
    * ui/ux, design, Document Object Model
  * React+Redux:
    * state, sessions
* server-side:
  * Heroku, GitHub pages, AWS:
    * static pages, hosting, deployment, scalability
  * MongoDB, sqlite:
    * models, queries, schema, objects, CRUD
  * Nodejs, Expressjs:
    * REST APIs, sessions, MVC, auth

???
* going to be **latest and greatest**
* no rails or django or php, none of that first or second gen tech here
* some of this stuff in actively changing
* surprisingly the web as a platform is **still rapidly evolving** - after being around for 20 years now
* desktop technology is much more stable/stodgy.
* **background and concepts behind the best practices and tool design**
* static vs server side rendered vs clientside
* don't worry we'll mostly just be **building all term long**!

name: Sample Weekly Projects

* get a domain and make some pages
* put yourself on a class map
* build a beautiful static landing page
* build a buzzfeed style quiz site
* build a realtime collaborative note-taking app
* classy content platform with all the bells and whistles
* api backend and databases


???

* think medium or pintrest or twitter CREATE RETRIEVE UPDATE DELETE
* shorter assignments will include building a bot and a mobile app
* someone has **said that course is like a firehose**, fine maybe it is a little intense but builds character
* **if you are a senior looking for an easy spring class, we might not work out, its not you its me, i just want you to love learning.**
