### full-stack web development.
## be the webdev.

[Tim Tregubov](http://zingweb.com)

???
* hi, my name is Tim Tregubov
* and I'm here to talk about CS52 full stack web development
* as you probably have experienced, the Web is a powerful delivery tool for complex real-time applications for important things like gifs and advertisements
* to less important things like productivity tools, data analysis, and governance.

name: Overview

.medium[![](img/cs52logo.png)]


???
* This is a  hands-on course that will introduce the state of the art of full-stack web development.
* You will learn to build not only interactive web applications, but also chatbots, and mobile apps. 
* This class will be an adventure and requires active participation both inside and outside of class. There will be lab projects, exercises in class, and a collaborative final project.
* 
* goals of the class: 
* use your knowledge of the fundamental concepts and best practices to design web systems from the ground up
* utilize state of the art tools and frameworks to build web technologies
* and build a bunch of your own web applications with front-end UIs and server-side APIs

???
* what is this full-stack thing?
* the stack is the set of tools/concepts/steps
  involved in building a modern client-server application
  (in particular on the web)
* how data is stored
* how data is communicated and transferred
* and finally how it is displayed and interacted with

???
* a full-stack dev is someone who has full working knowledge of all the components
* my favorite classes have always been those that empower me, after which i feel like i can conquer the world - this class will hopefully make you all magicians

name: CS52 Tech Stack and Concepts

* client-side:
  * HTML5/CSS3(SASS)/ES6:
      * ui/ux, design, Document Object Model, layout, markup, transpilers
  * React+Redux:
      * state, sessions, data driven interfaces, event-driven asynchronous programming
* the in-between:
  * internet protocols, security, application program interfaces
* server-side:
  * Heroku, GitHub pages, AWS:
      * static pages, hosting, deployment, scalability
  * MongoDB, sqlite:
      * databases, models, queries, schema, objects, CRUD
  * Nodejs, Expressjs:
      * REST APIs, sessions, MVC, authentication, concurrency

???
* here's some words on a page - but the point is you'll learn the 
* **background and concepts behind best practices and scalable software design**
* we'll learn the **latest and greatest** tools and why they are the way they are
* but more importantly we'll **build lots of projects along the way**!
* we're **not going to dumb things down** so you'll be doing industry standard stuff, no starter code
* the goal is to get you to be comfortable going from an blank terminal to a full project

name: Sample Weekly Projects

* get a domain and make some pages
* put yourself on a class map
* build a beautiful static landing page
* build a buzzfeed style quiz site
* build a realtime collaborative note-taking app
* classy content platform with all the bells and whistles
* api backend and databases


???

* students have **said that course is like a firehose**, it's nonstop work, but that builds character
* in anycase **if you are looking for an easy spring class, we might not work out, its not you its me, i just want you to love learning and building cool products.**

???
* there is a 3 week group final project, for which we will use collaborative coding and agile project management to help us do it remotely.  we'll use zoom and github and slack.
* this is where everything you've learned comes together and every year the projects dazzle and impress - you'll be surprised by what you can build in 3 weeks.

* class time 2A — 2:25-4:15pm via Zoom:
  * half lecture / half workshop / demos / code and project discussions
* x-hours — 4:35-5:25pm every Weds
  * me + tas + students @here to help
  * some xhours will be workshops

???
* half lecture / half workshop / demos / code and project discussions
* will be recorded for offline viewing also
* due to course size we'll have to use xhours for some stuff
* as the course goes on i'll talk less you'll talk more
* but it'll be action packed

name: Wait List?!?

.fancy.medium_small[![](img/giphy21.gif)]

* projects based
* interactive
* open syllabus
* <strike>auditing</strike>
* from blank terminal to full project

???
* since this course is projects based we can only scale it so far and still provide meaningful mentorship and teaching, hence the cap
* there is a large waitlist for the course and so it is not available for shopping
