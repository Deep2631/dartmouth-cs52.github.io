client ⇔ server ⇔ database

.large[![](img/sampleweb.gif)]

???
* full working knowledge of all the components
* how data is stored
* how it is served
* how it is displayed
* my favorite classes have always been those that empower

name: CS52 Tech Stack

* client-side:
  * HTML5/CSS3(SASS)/ES6:
    * ui/ux, design, Document Object Model
  * React+Redux:
    * state, sessions
* server-side:
  * Heroku, GitHub pages, AWS:
    * static pages, hosting, deployment, scalability
  * MongoDB, sqlite:
    * models, queries, schema, objects, CRUD
  * Nodejs, Expressjs:
    * REST APIs, sessions, MVC, auth

???
* going to be latest and greatest
* no rails or django or php, none of that first or second gen tech here
* some of this stuff in actively changing
* suprisingly the web as a platform is still rapidly evolving
* desktop native app technology is much more stable/stodgy.
* background and concepts behind the best practices and tool design
* static vs server side rendered vs clientside
* don't worry we'll mostly just be building all term long!

* <strike>auditing</strike>
* oh and bring laptops to every class
* from blank terminal to full project

???
* 130 people tried to get into this course
* you are the few the proud
* second time around, but still an experiment
* not going to dumb things down so you'll be doing industry standard stuff, no web ide's or lots of starter code.

name: Grading

- In-class short assignments: 10%
- 5ish week-long labs:  25%
- Short In-class quizzes:  10%
- 1 group presentation and workshop: 10%
- group workshop participation:  10%
- 1 final project:  30%
- class participation:  5%

* late penalty:
  * -1% of assignment per hour
  * 2 allowed re-submits (capped at 80%)


???
* may be adjusted slightly
* all assignments individual except for final and workshop
* workshops - learn and teach a technology and get everybody exposed to many things
* note: participation is .25% per class!
* workshops will be graded (in the past they weren't)
* re-submits (must have submitted something)
* hopefully class isn't super boring - at least your workshops will be interesting

name: Extra Credit is Real


<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/wapSaE3rNQoZa" width="271" height="480" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>

???
* up to 110% per each assignment

---
name: Workshop?

.medium[![](img/leviosa.gif)]

* Workshop: sign up to present some cool tech as a team
  * present how its used / motivate it
  * write up a tutorial on it, teach us!
  * you'll be the experts!


???

* idea is to learn something well enough to teach it
* and become a resource for it
* everybody gets exposed to many technologies
* workshops will be graded (in the past they weren't)


---
name: Project Demos


.medium[![](img/hanoverinn.jpg)]

* what to work towards
* show off your work!
* invite your friends!

???
* together with cs98 and dali
* 500+ people
* not presentations (science fair style)

name: Quizzes?!?!

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/u9hgTtUu0DDws?hideSocial=true" width="480" height="238.08" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>

* after each assignment
* if you did the assignment, you can do the quiz
* short
* fun?

???
* web is open platform - you can see a lot of the codes
* unfortunate assessment problem
* if you did the assignment should understand the concepts behind it




---
name: Code

.small[![](img/giphy_cheating.gif)]

* the internet is full of the codes
  * cite every line from stackoverflow, google, wikipedia, etc
  * cite every line from a friend
* if (cite) { ~no penalty }
* else { mandatory vacation }

```javascript
// adapted from: http://stackoverflow.com/someurl
// this method does x and y
```

???
* internet full of codes is a good thing - we're all archeologists - puzzle solvers
* want you to be able to show your work - have lots of green squares on github
* do not copy from other students, they are not authoritative sources
* preferable don't look at others code - it may not be correct
* want you to be able to show your work
* story time from summer
  * provide lots of help
  * I offer lots of outs - worst case you panic, can't figure it out and you end up cheating - just cite it. you might get a 0 but you won't get a 2 term vacation.
* remember, I am hyper available, just talk to me
