 * establishes a connection between the application UI and business logic
 * when data changes value the elements that are bound to the data reflect changes
 * most UI frameworks have some form of data binding

name: Some React Postulates

1. Managing state is treacherous
1. Two-way bindings are evil
1. Data mutations can be tricky


???
* state: what radio button was clicked, what is being displayed etc
* transparency: effects of a code change should be limited/local, or at least easy to reason about
  * Also a useful concept regarding state change
  * Two-way bindings open Pandoraâ€™s box:
    * No easy way of knowing how far-reaching a change in the reverse direction is going to be
* mutable state and sideeffects are not transparen
* hard to test

name: Thinking In React


<ol>
    <li class="fragment">Start with a mock</li>
    <li class="fragment">Break the UI into a component hierarchy</li>
    <li class="fragment">Build a static version in React</li>
    <li class="fragment">Identify the minimal (but complete) representation of UI state</li>
    <li class="fragment">Identify where your state should live</li>
    <li class="fragment">Add inverse data flow</li>
    <li class="fragment">Style it</li>
    <li class="fragment">Ship it</li>
</ol>



???
1. mock: features + data
  * mock objects
1. components: single responsibility
1. static version: render methods with data (props, no state)
1. state:  minimal set of mutable state that your app needs
1. which component mutates/owns the state:
  * renders by state
  * common owner / or create one
1. Add inverse data flow: explicit events for changing state
1. profit
