???
* made a stacked graph
* so good thing is, lab3/4 were the hard part
* doing the server side will be much easier more clear
* and then its all final project all the time! get excite!
* this is not survey data - would like to collect some real data on how long / hard each assignment is, would you all help?

name: Liked

* The TAs,  I'm **seriously grateful to the TAs**, 
* Everybody seems really helpful and supportive, and we've done some pretty cool assignments!
* **learning cool concepts** and things I've never touched before
* Very hands on, **examples are always right to the point**
* I love the fact that I'm getting to use other technologies that I had used earlier, but never made full use of them
* I love the** creativity and the flexibility** we get with lab assignments. I've been** throwing myself into them** to keep distracted from everything else going on, and its been really nice actually.
* I **really enjoy the lectures**, I think they are helpful and engaging even though they're on zoom.
* appreciate **slack** as a resource, and I'm grateful that **response times** to questions are so fast.
* Making websites **from nothing is so cool**, I love this class. Also, the fun gifs/tik toks
* fact that I **want to send what I make in this class to everyone** I know makes me so excited to see what else we could create
* I love how we are building everything from scratch and actually **building really cool stuff** that impresses everyone ive talked to about it. Def a very empowering class. 
* I think you guys are brilliant in the way you respond on **Slack**. So quick,
* Material is interesting, **homework is related well** to the overarching material
* **Literally everything**. Dope projects, dope prof, dope TAs!!!
* The projects are really fun and have been the best way for me to understand the content taught in class. The **short assignments are a great bridge** from the core concepts in class and the labs.
* I've learned a lot and **found parts of coding that I really enjoy and some that I don't**, but that process is important.
* It's interesting and the **projects are really cool**. The prof and TAs are great.
* We** cover so much material**! The prof and TAs are amazing. It's extremely applicable
* **short assignments and slack**!
* Funny and engaging professor, **sheer breadth** of the material.
* How we are seeing **so many topics and dev environments and tools**


???
* ok well this seems good

name: Do Better

* **More React** pls
* not able to understand the concepts better bc it's online and there are so m**any assignments due**...I wish there were less assignments so I can **spend more time to practice**
* I think we could really benefit from an **in-depth analysis/rebuild of a top-notch (style wise) website**
* it can get overwhelming at times. However, I do know that it is only through these assignments that we learn the most
* It's **difficult to keep up with all the material** while basically learning a new language in every lab.
* I know this is something that probably can't be changed, but I feel like I **only understand the material at a very surface level**. 
* **More traditional office hours** where people can come with conceptual questions too. Sometimes I ask for help repeatedly and get no responses (e.g. tutorial)
*  I **don't think I retained much** from short assignment even though my code worked at the end
* **Assignment deadlines**.
* assignments seem daunting with a lot to do with little time/guidance
* **lectures could be a bit more engaging** with more hands on coding stuff. I know we have to understand the concepts and all before coding, but it sometimes gets hella confusing transitioning from "info dump mode" to "let's actually code something"! And I guess a part of me **doesn't know if the SAs fully fill that gap** since even the React one was confusing and we were just copy-pasting!
* Maybe add an **additional 1-day extension option (for 2 days total)**.
* don't feel like the classes effectively teaches **what needs to be done in the labs**.
* **struggle to understand where to begin in the labs**/how to program certain components, even after watching the lectures prior.
* most of the limitations of the course are **syntax and technical errors**
* slowing down the pace and giving a **better big picture overview during lectures** would be very helpful
* I'm **confused about the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and React** as a whole
* **slides that show maps/groupings of technologies are super helpful** in making us understand the grand scheme of things


???
* the shorts become a resource for you to look back on for the lab - most things are shown in the shorts - so like reusing a component, already in the short. look back on your code. 
* will send out info about my office hours - so far has been only by appointment
* deadlines generally are around a week for each of the labs and 3 days for each of the shorts - rearranging a lot this term, and would love to have more info about that for you. will try to commit. 
* additional day extension - done!
* we used to do some of the shorts in class together - but wasn't quite enough time for everyone
* will

name: Your Tips

* **read things more carefully**
* Definitely **start the assignments a little early**
* stop being afraid to **ask questions**, start working on assignments sooner
* **Try not to get distracted** during lectures
* **Take more advantage of office hours** and not be afraid to reach out to Tim directly.
* I should really** go to more office hours** lol because sometime when I'm coding, I **get a bit stubborn** and persistent trying to solve my own problems without help. I also want to try posting + responding on Slack more often. Again, I get a bit stubborn with problems, to the point where I end up in a loop and waste more time than necessary. Overall though, this has by far been my fav class at Dartmouth and I want to really nail this material
*  quite confused by the topics when they are first presented in the lectures, but after googling the topics for the labs for a while I get used to them. I want to find a way to **bridge that gap**.
* I can definitely work on improving my focus, maybe through more constant **note-taking** (I've been doing some note-taking and some just listening) 
* **spend more time** on the labs to really polish them
* rewatch videos
* Just the obvious things I guess: I can keep coming to the lecture and doing the assignments.
* **No idea I'm doing my best**


???
* some helpful tips from yourselves!
* yes please do reach out to me and ta and your sections
* just the act of writing things down even if you throw them out helps
*
