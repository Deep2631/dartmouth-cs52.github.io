* trying to understand the confusion of office hours - so let me know if you have thoughts on how to improve it,  i enjoy meeting you during my hours so please do keep stopping by. 
* don't be slack shy - use whisperbot if you want!

* made a stacked graph
* so good thing is, lab3/4 were the hard part
* doing the server side will be much easier more clear
* and then its all final project all the time! get excite!
* this is not survey data - would like to collect some real data on how long / hard each assignment is, would you all help?

name: Liked

* I'm **learning so many new things**. The finished product after each lab is satisfying.
* I actually have been really enjoying the assignments.
* I think **concepts are explained well**, and the assignments are great guides.
* I get to **build cool stuff** with tools I've never used before - this is all brand new to me
* I like that the class gives us the **freedom to learn the material purely through doing projects and short assignments**. I feel like this is how CS in general should be taught, rather than incorporating exam-esque elements.
* Labs are fun and **very satisfying when complete**
* I **love the concepts we're learning**. The fact that I have produced two websites now (that honestly look pretty good, I'll flex a lil) without having known HTML or CSS whatsoever before this class, I'm **super super proud** of myself. I feel like a real coder and like I could do this as my profession, and I finally feel like I am actually a CS major.
* i **really like the things ive created** and even though its a lot of work i really enjoy seeing and using my creations
* I **like the online video format**.
* Feels like I've **learned very practical / useful things**
* labs are fairly interesting, prof is funny
* love the **theoretical focus on JS and React**. maybe this isn't true for others, but talking about React from a **functional programming standpoint made everything click**.
* I like **motivating everything with the history behind all the tools**, since truly understanding current web technologies requires understanding how bad things would be without them
* I love the assignments and how free-form the extensions can be for extra credit!


???
* ok well this seems good

name: Do Better


* Iâ€™ve been inclined to kind of just **copy and paste the given code** into files rather than really be introduced into a new language/plugin
* I wish the **lectures were more assignment based** rather than just a general overview of the languages.
* The course feels **too asynchronous** for me. I would love more interaction with classmates and the Prof outside of office hours.
* Provide videos that help improve my understanding of HOW to use the tools
* The **pacing of the course can feel overwhelming**. After I finished SA4 I felt like I was going to have time to breathe and the I saw a notification for Lab 3, and slowly the dread of having a lab, an exam and two incoming essays filled the air. Granted, I actually enjoy doing the work for the course
* A bit **more guidance in the beginning**
* Some of the concepts have been explained more like a "here's a general overview, but you'll really understand it as you actually work with it in the assignments." This worked for labs 1 and 2, but for lab 3, I really think that react is a whole different ballgame, and a lot more guidance would be really really helpful.
* **more office hours and live classes**
* If lectures were broken up into **shorter videos**, like say two 20-25 minute videos for one day of class,
* The CSS and HTML videos had **too many tangents**.
* Lectures often wander, are inefficient, lack cohesion, feel almost divorced from labs + sas in some ways
* I would like a more **centralized document with all the resources**
* A schedule with due dates



???
* the shorts become a resource for you to look back on for the lab - most things are shown in the shorts - so like reusing a component, already in the short. look back on your code. 
* we used to do some of the shorts in class together - but wasn't quite enough time for everyone and the interactive time together most people felt like was a waste of time
* but we'll do more live things as projects start up next week i promise! 
* so far the idea for the lectures is background and general knowledge and then the only way to really learn it is by doing - as a student i always hated watching coding sessions and just wanted to do it myself.
* but i am working on redoing all the lectures into shorter videos.  i like that asynch allows for more one-on-one time, but also not quite sure it works
* each term i want to send out a full schedule, but then as the course goes on each time ends up being a bit different based on how the class is doing, but yes, heard and will publish the rest of term shortly.

name: Your Tips

* **keep up with due dates** and **ask for help** when i need it
* **Start the labs earlier**, and stop procrastinating on the videos
* I'll continue watching the videos and tackling the homework assignments as good of an extent as I can. It's often hard to put as much focus as I'd like because of other courses but I think I have been satisfied with my work regardless
* I should probably **go to office hours, even if I don't necessarily need help**.
* I need to keep **doing the extra credit - it helps expand my skill set**
* **stop being afraid** of asking "stupid" questions
* I should **read more example code**; I often get confused about syntax and "how to do things" in JS(X)
* I could stop and **say hello to Tim** some time :)

<!-- * **read things more carefully**
* Definitely **start the assignments a little early**
* stop being afraid to **ask questions**, start working on assignments sooner
* **Try not to get distracted** during lectures
* **Take more advantage of office hours** and not be afraid to reach out to Tim directly.
* I should really** go to more office hours** lol because sometime when I'm coding, I **get a bit stubborn** and persistent trying to solve my own problems without help. I also want to try posting + responding on Slack more often. Again, I get a bit stubborn with problems, to the point where I end up in a loop and waste more time than necessary. Overall though, this has by far been my fav class at Dartmouth and I want to really nail this material
*  quite confused by the topics when they are first presented in the lectures, but after googling the topics for the labs for a while I get used to them. I want to find a way to **bridge that gap**.
* I can definitely work on improving my focus, maybe through more constant **note-taking** (I've been doing some note-taking and some just listening) 
* **spend more time** on the labs to really polish them
* rewatch videos
* Just the obvious things I guess: I can keep coming to the lecture and doing the assignments.
* **No idea I'm doing my best** -->


???
* some helpful tips from yourselves!
* yes please do reach out to me and ta and your sections
* i swear these are what you all put down, most comments said start earlier
