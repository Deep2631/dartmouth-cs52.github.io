* Use Slack with specific #sa #lab channels and

???
* For help over video to debug or ask conceptual questions use Tandem:
* add your name on the sheet below + brief description of what you need help with 
* try to describe the problem/question without code, but feel free to paste in short error messages.
* Log into Tandem
* Wait for a TA (donâ€™t barge into a Tandem room! A TA will reach out when itâ€™s your turn!)
* In some cases a TA may group questions together and start a Tandem Room to address the question.  In that case weâ€™ll comment as such.
* For help over messaging any time of day/night use Slack and find the channel associated with the short or lab you are working on.
* we'll see how this works or doesn't - might switch to zoom with waiting rooms

name: HyperText Markup Language

HTML != programming

* today HTML only - next class is CSS - there's a difference
* html not like python and Java - no logic
* just like this cat is not really a panda
* It is a descriptor language.
  * describes what things are
  * not how they work or **even how they look**

???
* HTML describes the structure of a document semantically
* no operations or actions
* can't compute with it
* but you can define structure.  
* When someone says they can program in HTML, look at them funny. ðŸ˜‘
* WORD analogy - in word you typically just say, italize this, change the font here - thats not scalable - if you do redefine styles in word kudos

[Uniform Resource Locators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator)

.orange[protocol]://.blue[host][:port]/.green[path][?query][#fragment]

Absolute URLs consist of at least three parts:

* the .orange[protocol] (`http://`, `https://`, `etc`)
* the name of the .blue[host] (`www.domainname.com`)
* the .green[path] to the given resource (`/assets/image.jpg`)

???




---

.orange[protocol:[//host][:port]][/]path[?query][#fragment]

  * path can be relative to current page location
  * `<img src="assets/image.jpg" />`
    in
    `http://www.domainname.com/people/me.html`

    `http://www.domainname.com/people/assets/image.jpg`.
* `../` directory above
* `/` base url


???



---
name: query

`protocol://host[:port]/path[`.orange[`?query`]`][#fragment]`

* `?query`
  * is an optional set of arguments
  * `?foo=bar&search=help`
  * can be processed by host
  * only way to send data in `GET`

???
* data out in the open but often used for id's and such




---
name: fragment

`protocol:[//host[:port]][/]path[?query][` .orange[`#fragment`] `]`

* `#fragment`
  * an optional fragment identifier
  * usually refers to an `id` of an element
  * browsers will scroll to fragment if it is an element id!

???
* some frontend frameworks use # identifiers for routing
* is a bit old fashioned as browsers now support push history (more on that later)






---
name: Document

So far everything we've looked at has been snippets.  The full HTML document has just a few more default tags.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>page title</title>
    <!-- often load various CSS or required js files here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- all your content here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

???
* migth see more complicated doctypes usually xhtml just more strict
* you should be strict on yourself regardless
* can have meta tags for things like author




---
name: define my own semantics?

What if I want a `slide` or a `profile-image`?

* html5 spec has some support
  * requires javascript / not widely used
* BUT
  * you can use `class` and `id` attributes
  * and `div` and `span` elements.
  * is the way to create your own structure markers

???
* ok structure over style.
* what about other semantic tags?
* but there are generic tags that you can give id's and classes to!
* REACT will give us more powerful abstraction





---
name: class

```html
<div class="slide">the contents of this slide</div>
<img class="profile" src="" />
```

* elements with `class`:
  * belong to a set of elements with some meaning (and style)
  * space separated string attribute `"one-class another-class"`
  * inherits from both


???
* By adding a `class` to an element you are saying it belongs to **set of elements** that mean a certain thing and should be styled a particular way
* Where styled really means **selected** or **grouped**.
* The `class` property is assigned a space separated quoted string with potentially multiple classes. `class="aclass"` but also `class="aclass anotherclass"` this is convenient as you can have one element belong to multiple style classes, inheriting styles from each!  




---
name: IDs

```html
<a id="username" hre="...">A unique username link</a>
```

* elements with `id`:
  * most likely uniquely identified on the page
  * have special role
  * `primary_navbar` or `username_field`
  * single string no spaces  - can only have 1 id


???
* Define your meaning and style information once and use it in many places.
* properly classing and iding your html structure will be critical once we start styling it.





---
name: Inline Elements

.fancy.small[![](img/inline.gif)]

* does not start on a new line

---
name: Block Element

.fancy.small[![](img/block.gif)]

```html

<p>
<form>
<ul>
<div>
```


???
fills parent element




---
name: span

* [`span` elements](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_span.asp)
  * don't take up space by default
  * `display: inline`
  * `<p>and then they said, <span class="quote">spans are for babies!</span>.</p>`

???
* is a generic inline element
* have no default style and can be used inline with other tags.  For instance to separate a word from a sentence.




---
name: div

* [`div` elements (divisions)](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp)
  * take up space by default
  * `display: block;`
  * `<div>on one line</div><div>on the line below</div>`

???




---
name: Nesting Elements

* most elements can be nested but with caveats
  * block inside block ok, but not `p` or `h*`
  * block not nested in inline
  * strict nesting no overlaps

```html
<p> <p>stuff</p></p> <!-- no -->

<span><h1>Hello</h1></span> <!-- no -->

<div><h1>hello</div></h1> <!-- wtf no -->
