* hardware failures alone...
* power
* backup
* network
* cooling
* failures
* some numbers thrown around for cost per search in terms of electricity ends up being 1$ cent to 1$ depending on how much of the infrastructure you include. if only google then 1c if you include your computer, all the internet from your computer to google, all the routers used while google crawls pages and then the number goes up.
