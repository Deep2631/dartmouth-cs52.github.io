name: Web Dev Solutions @scale

* Challenges:
  * WhatsApp: "irresponsible and explosive messages"
  * Facebook: “By updating the rules for the Internet, we can preserve what’s best about it — the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things — while also protecting society from broader harms”
  * Slack: noise over knowledge
* Many Opportunities:
  * resource sharing
  * health
  * education
  * society

???
* whatsapp - theoretically brings people together - but also mob lynchings.
* slack: productivity tool but also makes people feel productive when they are asking and answering questions that should have been documented better - millions of hours of productivity lost - people spending online instead of with their families
* be mindful 
* lots of industries where scale will bring change
* health - small monitoring and motivation improvements can extend lifespans, increase happiness
* society - bringing people actually closer rather than dividing them - may be VR
* as soon as you start thinking in terms of scale - everything gets more interesting
* and you've just learned the tools that enable solutions @scale
