* why aren't JS objects automatically bound to their context? what's the benefit of not.

```js
function handleClick(e) {
  this.innerHTML="you clicked me!"
}

document.getElementById('button')
  .addEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

.large[![](img/ohgahd-table.jpg)]

???
*  in this example, handleClick needs `this` to refer to the calling owner (ie the button).
* might want to use this in quizzical

name: table questions

* is it universally accepted that ES6 is better, or is there a debate against it?
* does ES6 move JS to object oriented programming?

.medium[![](img/house-table.jpg)]


???
* there are quite a few debates in general about javascript language features, but no ES6 is superior in every way. some people might want more or different changes, but nobody wants less.
* it helps with some object oriented style with the new `class` syntax but it also introduces new functional methods such as the arrow functions and generators and iterators.

* objects that allow you iterate through a sequence while keeping track of position and providing a next funciton
* generator is a function that acts as an iterator. can return intermediate values for instance.

name: brief frameworks history

  * exits after returning page
  * stateless
  * original LAMP stack -- linux+apache+mysql+perl

```bash
perl -e 'print "<html>Hello World</html>"'
```

???
* server spits out full display html





---
name: 1st gen web frameworks

* template: mix code and HTML
* web specific libraries:
  * url handling
  * html generation
  * sessions
  * database interfaces

```php
<?php echo '<h1>Hello World</h1>'; ?>
```

???
* server side rendering
* language runtime directly in web server (faster)




---
name: 2nd gen serverside frameworks

.tiny[![](img/dj_vs_ror.jpeg)]

* Ruby on Rails, Django
* Model-View-Controller:
  * abstracted structure
* Object Relational Mapping (ORM):
  * simply database use
  * use objects instead of SQL

```ruby
def home
  @greeting = "howdy"
end
```

???
* note these all fit in to Server Side Rendering





---
name: 3rd gen serverside frameworks

.tiny[![](img/express-js-node-js.png)]

* Express, Flask, Sinatra
* lightweight
* optional mvc but less rigid
* module based rather than monolothic
  * ex: use any templating engine
* options vs the one way

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('hi');
});
```

???






---
name: 3rd gen frontend frameworks

.tiny[![](img/backbone-logo.png)]


* AngularJS, Backbone
* clientside javascript frameworks
* handle dynamic data on frontend
* templates
* optional mvc
* rise of api architecture

```js
var AppView = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: _.template("<h3>Hello <%= who %></h3>"),
  render: function(){
    this.$el.html(this.template({who: 'world!'}));
  }
});
```


???
* some of these have gone through multiple generations themselves
* and then there is REACT!   4th gen!



---
name: MVC

![](img/mvc_tt.png)


???
* mvc is common code architecture pattern - specifically for uis
* model stores your datas, objects
* controller operates on the datas
* view presents it, webpage
* can be both frontend and backend
  * often both!
  * frontend for managing data objects loaded in browsers
  * server for database
  * servers views are JSON api (but very minimal mostly just controller)
* lots of alternatives mvvc mcp etc etc.  




---
name: Templating for Views

.medium[![](img/templating.png)]

* all frameworks â€” end product html/css
* write html for parts of page that don't change
* code for dynamic parts
* execute template to fill in code parts


???
* benefits of templates
* designer friendly
* easy to test





---
name: mvc popular but

* invented in the 70s
* helps organize architecture
* modern applications need more scalability
* mvc can be heavy, too much data loaded, too many views


???
* we'll keep talking about mvc, more next week!
* BUT we're also going to move on to 4rth more modern tooling!

  * super fast virtual dom

???



---
name: Virtual DOM?

.medium_small.fancy[![](img/reactjs-virtual-dom-real-dom.png)]


* isn't one DOM already enough?!?!
* DOM is slow
* Virtual DOM allows for faster DOM manipulation
* Virtual DOM simpler and faster
  * React diffs Virtual DOM and DOM
  * only updates what is changed


???
* dom trees are large, react component virtual tree is smaller
* saved unneccessary dom manipulation (state changes but don't need to rerender a lot of stuff)




---
name: tree diffs

* wouldn't comparing trees be expensive?
  * $O(n^{3})$ yes
  * but React does it in $O(n)$

???





---
name: dirty state

.medium[![](img/setstate-dirty.png)]


???
* when you run `setstate` it markes a node as dirty
* potentially rerendering the entire subtree but in practice is performant

name: rerendering

.medium[![](img/dirty-rerendered.png)]

---
name: components

* React is component based:
  * encapsulated reusable containers
  * logic + rendering
  * no state in the DOM
* components:
  * have `state`
  * take in `props` as args
  * nested
  * can `render`

???
* we'll be talking a lot about component this component that
* everything is a component in react
* each node in virtual DOM is component
* trees on trees on trees




---
name: state old way

```javascript
$("button").on("click", function(button) {
  if(button.value=="OFF") {
      button.value="ON";
  } else {
      button.value="OFF";
  }
});
```

gross

???
* storing state in the DOM
* have to query for it if we want to know anything
* super gross
* slight exaggeration but still





---
name: state new way

```javascript
<button onClick={() => this.setState({ button: !button })} />
```

* prettier?

???
* fp principles
* each component has local state which is an object (dictionary/hashmap)
* has method `setState` to change it
* never mutate state directly without `setState`






---
name: JSX

```javascript
const aDivElement = <div className="foo" />;

const aComponent = <MyComponent someProperty={true} />;
```

* JSX is html-like syntax for defining react tree nodes
* create JS objects



???
* react components rendering is definied in JSX
* this is where babel comes in





---
name: component lifecycle


.medium[![](img/component-lifecycle.png)]

* `setState` and `setProps` are key
* methods that get called at different times during the life of the page

* components have lifecycle methods




---

.medium_small[![](img/data-event-flow.png)]

* parent components send data down as `props`
* children pass up actions in callbacks

* this can get a little tricky as you'll see
* but i believe in you, you'll practice and this will all become second nature to you - i know.
* buuut next week we'll learn how to manage that in larger apps
* need to refresh what a callback is?
