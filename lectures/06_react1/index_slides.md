* why aren't JS objects automatically bound to their context? what's the benefit of not.

```js
function handleClick(e) {
  this.innerHTML="you clicked me!"
}

document.getElementById('button')
  .addEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

* is it universally accepted that ES6 is better, or is there a debate against it?
* does ES6 move JS to object oriented programming?

.medium[![](img/house.jpg)]


???
* there are quite a few debates in general about javascript language features, but no ES6 is superior in every way. some people might want more or different changes, but nobody wants less.
* it helps with some object oriented style with the new `class` syntax but it also introduces new functional methods such as the arrow functions and generators and iterators.

* objects that allow you iterate through a sequence while keeping track of position and providing a next funciton
* generator is a function that acts as an iterator.

  * need to build outputs to files
  * host static output files
  * would not be running webpack-dev-server

name: Node and NPM

* `npm` is package manager
  * downloads js modules
  * uses `package.json` file to `--save` dependencies
  * can share project with `package.json` file

.small[![](img/1n64e1.jpg)]

???
* package.json file allows other devs or Heroku to load your project
* no need to include the giant amounts of dependencies in your actual project git

* Node is javascript interpreter without a browser
* used for server side processing
* used for desktop js apps like Atom

---
name: brief frameworks history

* web v0: static HTML files only
* web v1: Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
  * URLs map to executable programs that return HTML
  * exits after returning page
  * stateless
  * LAMP stack -- linux+apache+mysql+perl

???
* server spits out full display html





---
name: 1st gen web frameworks

* php, asp.net, java
* language runtime directly in web server (faster)
* template: mix code and HTML
* web specific libraries:
  * url handling
  * html generation
  * sessions
  * database interfaces

???
* server side rendering





---
name: 2nd gen serverside frameworks

* Ruby on Rails, Django
* Model-View-Controller:
  * abstracted structure
* Object Relational Mapping (ORM):
  * simply database use
  * use objects instead of SQL

???
* note these all fit in to Server Side Rendering





---
name: 3rd gen serverside frameworks


* Express, Flask, Sinatra
* lightweight
* optional mvc but less rigid
* module based rather than monolothic
  * ex: use any templating engine
* options vs the one way


???






---
name: 3rd gen frontend frameworks



* AngularJS, Backbone
* clientside javascript frameworks
* handle dynamic data on frontend
* templates
* optional mvc
* rise of api architecture


???
* some of these have gone through multiple generations themselves
* react is a bit on the new side




---
name: MVC

.medium[![](img/mvc_tt.png)]


???
* mvc is common pattern
* model stores your datas, objects
* controller operates on the datas
* view presents it, webpage
* can be both frontend and backend
  * often both!
  * frontend for managing data objects loaded in browsers
  * server for database
  * servers views are JSON api






---
name:

.medium[![](img/templating.png)]

* all frameworks â€” end product html/css
* write html for parts of page that don't change
* code for dynamic parts
* execute template to fill in code parts


???
* benefits of templates
* designer friendly
* easy to test





---
name: mvc popular but

* invented in the 70s
* helps organize architecture
* modern applications need more scalability
* mvc can be heavy, too much data loaded, too many views


???
* we'll keep talking about mvc so don't worry
* BUT we're also going to move on to 4rth more modern tooling!

* what is React and why?
* basic render function and virtual dom
* class components
* component state
* smart and dumb components

???




---
name: React

* V in MVC
* but actually more
  * super fast virtual dom

???



---
name: Virtual DOM?

* isn't one DOM already enough?!?!
* DOM is slow
* Virtual DOM allows for faster DOM manipulation
* Virtual DOM simpler and faster
  * React diffs Virtual DOM and DOM
  * only updates what is changed


???





---
name: tree diffs

* wouldn't comparing trees be expensive?
  * $O(n^{3})$ yes
  * but React does it in $O(n)$

---
name: dirty state

.medium_small[![](img/setstate-dirty.png)]


???
* when you run setstate it markes a node as dirty
* potentially rerendering the entire subtree but in practice is performant

name: rerendering

.medium_small[![](img/dirty-rerendered.png)]

---
name: components

* React is component based:
  * encapsulated reusable containers
  * logic + rendering
  * no state in the DOM
* components are just functions:
  * have `state`
  * `props` as arg
  * nested

???
* everything is a component in react
* each node in virtual DOM is component




---
name: state old way

```javascript
$("button").on("click", function(button) {
  if(button.value=="OFF") {
      button.value="ON";
  } else {
      button.value="OFF";
  }
});
```

gross

???
* storing state in the DOM
* have to query for it if we want to know anything
* super gross





---
name: state new way

```javascript
<button onClick={() => this.setState({ button: !button })} />
```

* prettier?

???
* fp principles
* each component has local state which is an object (dictionary/hashmap)
* has method `setState` to change it
* never mutate state directly without `setState`






---
name: JSX

```javascript
const aDivElement = <div className="foo" />;

const aComponent = <MyComponent someProperty={true} />;
```

* JSX is html-like syntax for defining react tree nodes
* create JS objects



???
* this is where babel comes in





---
name: component lifecycle


.medium_small[![](img/component-lifecycle.png)]

* `setState` and `setProps` are key


???





---
name: down data flow

.medium_small[![](img/data-event-flow.png)]

* parent components send data down as `props`
* children pass up actions in callbacks

???
* this can get a little tricky as you'll see in SA3
* buuut next week we'll learn how to manage that in larger apps
