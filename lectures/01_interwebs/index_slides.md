???
These local servers can't know every name however.
1. local name server will ask a ROOT server to find out which TLD (top level domain) server to ask.  TLDs are the various .com, .org, .ly, .website, domains.
2. then local name server will ask the TLD what it knows about that domain name. The TLD will return the authoritative name servers that are set up when you register a domain name.  (we'll do that next class!)
3. then finally the local name server will query the authoritative name server.  
Large organizations may run their own DNS servers (CS runs its own as does Dartmouth), but registrars like godaddy(bad) and [namecheap](http://namecheap.com)(good) do as well.

---
name: Routing Logic
When a router gets a datagram (what we've been calling a packet) it does some logic similar to the following:

```python
Given a destination IP address, D, and network prefix, N:

if ( N matches a directly connected network address )
    Deliver datagram to D over that network link
else if ( The routing table contains a route for N )
    Send datagram to the next-hop address
    listed in the routing table;
else if ( There exists a default route )
    Send datagram to the default route
else
    Send a forwarding error message to the originator
```

*(from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_forwarding))*

???
* at the most basic level, more complicated algorithms exist
* network prefix 129.170 is dartmouths prefix

.fancy.medium[![routing announcements](img/routing_announcements.png)]

Routers use a protocol called BGP to exchange routing information with each other.  

???
* Dartmouth's Border Router üõÇshouts: *Hey I know stuff about 129.170.0.0/16 (Dartmouth)*  
* nearby routers will each record that they are 0 hops away from that particular internet prefix block and will tell others about it
*  Their neighbors will also record their distance and so on and so forth.  
* Each router stores a routing table with entries about which of their neighbors knows about which routes and also the distance (simplest metric is just hop count).

* This is what enables the internet to be robust, if a link goes down, then there are usually alternate/longer routes available.
