* ok so i want them to learnt that they should first make some sketches to plan out generally what different views do,  i want them to learn that they should spend some time and find design inspiration - which can literally be things they can copy. i want them to be aware of color scheme pickers so that they do horrendous stuff like  a bunch of primary colors,  i want them to be aware of hierarchy so that they consciously thingk about what people are looking at noticing first when they go to the page
