???
* just some tips
* sorry for the repeat for those of you who have heard this before
* not really a designer (tried to go to graphic design school many years ago though)
* here's what I've learned from hanging around designers
* based on working on hundreds of projects


---
name: But I just want to code!!

.fancy.small[![](img/coding.webp)]

*ðŸ’³credit given for design work*<br>
*and it'll turn out better*


???
* **cowhand** coding - just leads to manure code
* just jumping in will lead to having a big ol mess of features
* stuff you don't even need to build
* i'm happy to help
* also office hours / open lab hours in DALI have many designers happy to help
* doesn't hurt to learn
* credit given for design work



---
name: Step 0a: Inspiration Board

* find examples of similar products
* take screenshots / save urls
* copy color schemes

.fancy.medium[![](img/inspiration.jpg)]


???
* other people have made pretty designs,  look at them, use them for inspiration, copy them as best you can
* you've all been keeping these already right?   
* inspiration boards are the **biggest difference between good designers and pretenders**.  if a designer starts with an inspiration board you can see their thought process and it is obvious in the final product that they thought about what they were making

name: Step 1: Sketches

* paper is best
* quickly jot down views and functionalities

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/d26EH3VCAHS12?hideSocial=true" width="380" height="284" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>


???
* make them on paper first
* much faster
* we'll try to get to that today

---
name: Step 2: Mockups

* with inspiration and sketches
* start on mockups ([Figma](http://figma.com))
* don't code them yet

.fancy.medium[![mockups](img/mockupthings.jpg)]


???
* the case for mockups:
* help you remember what needs to be built
* much quicker to play around with different options quickly and easily to determine what works best for your product
* coordinate with your team - keep everybody on track
* Figma is like google docs for design - super

name: Importance of User Flow

.medium[![mockups](img/robot.jpg)]


???
* but also use figma for storyboard - upload sketches - use primative shapes / icons


---
name: Step 3: Functional Mockups

* put mockups together
* build with [Figma](https://help.figma.com/article/199-getting-started-with-prototyping)

.fancy.medium[[![figma prototyping](img/proto-figma-2.gif)](https://help.figma.com/article/199-getting-started-with-prototyping)]

???
* great way to test your interactions
* woop forgot some logic path from one view to another
* can run it by users and see if they can figure it out
* again for the AR or robot projects - can use sketches or shapes and words



---
name: Colors

* Not just random
* Use a color scheme chooser: [color.adobe.com](http://color.adobe.com)
* Steal from other sites

.fancy.medium[[![adobe color](img/adobecolor.gif)](http://color.adobe.com)]

???
* picking colors
* beg, borrow, steal color schemes


---
name: Hierarchy

* visual hierarchy
* what users see first, order of gaze
* visual saliency

.fancy.medium[[![fpatttern](img/fpattern2.jpeg)](https://uxplanet.org/f-shaped-pattern-for-reading-content-80af79cd3394)]


???

* laying out your page, remember to think about the visual hierarchy
* ordering of what users see based on size/color/movement
* What will users eyes see first, your call to action, or the large user profile button that they never really need to go to
* Try to imagine what you would notice first as a new user and then order your elements in terms of visual saliency appropriately
* Larger and brighter colored things tend to be noticed first
* Positioning also matters, we tend to look at things in a [letter F pattern](https://uxplanet.org/f-shaped-pattern-for-reading-content-80af79cd3394).

UX is like a joke...

???
* famous designer
* every choice you make conveys something
* you chose blue for a restaurant site because you like blue
* but blue is not appetizing, doesn't make people feel hungry - RED does weird.
* think about and defend every choice you make - 'i just like it' doesn't cut it.
* hidden interaction like swiping or hamburger - be careful.
* ux is like a joke - its bad if it needs explaining
* can use this time to test that!

"Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said that the two percent decline in daily active users was "primarily driven" by a lower frequency of use among the company's user base due to "the disruption caused by our redesign." "

* 1.2 million users signed a petition
* 3 million users lost
* i always found the hidden slides to be confusing but changing things once people get used to it is even worse
