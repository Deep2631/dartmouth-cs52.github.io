* just some tips
* not really a designer (tried to go to graphic design school many years ago though)
* here's what I've learned from hanging around designers
* based on working on hundreds of projects


---
name: Step 1: Inspiration Board

* find examples of similar products
* take screenshots
* save urls
* copy color schemes
* cool tool: [milanote board](https://www.milanote.com/refer/rcAxjfzasgu2C6IoR8)

.fancy.medium[![](img/inspiration.jpg)]

???
* other people have made pretty designs,  look at them, use them for inspiration, copy them as best you can


---
name: Step 2a: Sketches

* paper is best
* quickly jot down views and functionalities

name: Step 2b: Sketches

* use [device paper](http://sneakpeekit.com/)
* use [PopPaper](https://marvelapp.com/pop/)

.super-tiny[![mockups](img/popapp-prototype-animation.gif)]


???
* make them on paper first
* much faster



---
name: Step 3: Mockups

* with inspiration and sketches
* start on mockups ([figma](http://figma.com), [sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com), etc)
* don't code them yet

.fancy.medium[![mockups](img/mockupthings.jpg)]


???
* the case for mockups:
* help you remember what needs to be built
* much quicker to play around with different options quickly and easily to determine what works best for your product
* coordinate with your team - keep everybody on track

---
name: Step 4: Functional Mockups

* put mockups together
* built in to [Figma](http://figma.com) or
* Invision: https://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup
* or even PopPaper: https://marvelapp.com/pop/

.fancy.medium[[![invision](img/invision.gif)](http://invisionapp.com)]

???
* great way to test your interactions
* woop forgot some logic path from one view to another
* can run it by users and see if they can figure it out



---
name: Colors

* Not just random
* Use a color scheme chooser: [color.adobe.com](http://color.adobe.com)
* Steal from other sites

.fancy.medium[[![adobe color](img/adobecolor.gif)](http://color.adobe.com)]

???
* picking colors
* beg, borrow, steal color schemes




---
name: Hierarchy

* visual hierarchy
* what users see first, order of gaze
* visual saliency

.fancy.medium[[![fpatttern](img/fpattern2.jpeg)](https://uxplanet.org/f-shaped-pattern-for-reading-content-80af79cd3394)]


???

* laying out your page, remember to think about the visual hierarchy
* ordering of what users see based on size/color/movement
* What will users eyes see first, your call to action, or the large user profile button that they never really need to go to
* Try to imagine what you would notice first as a new user and then order your elements in terms of visual saliency appropriately
* Larger and brighter colored things tend to be noticed first
* Positioning also matters, we tend to look at things in a [letter F pattern](https://uxplanet.org/f-shaped-pattern-for-reading-content-80af79cd3394).

.fancy.medium[![mockups](img/quote.jpg)]

UX is like a joke...

???
* famous designer
* every choice you make conveys something
* think about and defend every choice you make - 'i just like it' doesn't cut it.
* hidden interaction like swiping or hamburger - be careful.
* ux is like a joke - its bad if it needs explaining
* can use this time to test that!

---
name: Appetizing?


.fancy.left[![mockups](img/appetite-blue-toast.jpg)]
.fancy.right[![mockups](img/bluerice.jpg)]

???
* but blue is not appetizing, doesn't make people feel hungry - RED does weird.

---
name: Flux Express


.fancy[![mockups](img/flux-design.jpg)]

???
* you chose blue for a restaurant site because you like blue
* but blue isn't appetizing - they rebranded multiple times
* it looks clean - until you realize you're supposed to order food
